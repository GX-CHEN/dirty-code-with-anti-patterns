# Why this book exist
If you're a software developer, or anyone whose job related to programming, there's a great chance you worked with some less-than-ideal code. These code can be called: "confusing code code", "buggy code", "not maintainable code", "dirty code", "legacy code" etc.
The root cause for these dirty code varies, the following are some potential reasons:
1. Not polish the code after "it works", due to deadline
2. "Someone else break my code", regression due to new code
3. Lack of coding conventions in the team

In order to avoid dirty code and anti-patterns, we first need to aware what is bad, so we can keep it in mind to avoid them. Some of the examples are intuitive to recognize "its' bad", while other examples could be hard to identify. This book contains a few sections, each of them focus on a category of dirty code examples. Most of the examples are provided using both Java and JavaScript, except for the language specific example.
